# KMIT-ONLINE CLASS ATTENDER
This is an automatic class attender.<br>



We all know attending online classes is a mess.
so what this api does is it basically joins the class and sends message to your discord.

In case of any library requirements the bot is bulid is such a way it installs the requirements itself.<br>
so just sit behind and watch the show.ðŸ˜‰

# Configure
  There are few things you need to configure before using the bot.<br>
  ->This bot only takes you class page so to join you need to use extention.
  # For google
   as of googele it just takes you to the join page.<br>
   you can install this <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-enhancement-s/ljojmlmdapmnibgflmmminacbjebjpno?h1=en">extention</a> and turn on auto join which also turms your mic and video off while joining<br>
   or you can just do that yourself.
  # For zoom
   zoom does'nt require any extentions but you can turn on auto connect audio, auto mic,video off something like that in settings.<br>
   also for the first time you need check the alert that pops up to open zoom class to trust this site. so it does'nt ask you everytime.<br>
   
   yup! thats it!it takes time to set these things up but it's worth it.<br>
   afterall at the end of the day everything is for attendence.ðŸ˜‚<br>
